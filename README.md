# Rikkokiri's dotfiles

My quite basic dotfile setup that will hopefully evolve.

## Installation

> Note:
The bootstrap.exclude.sh script creates symlinks from the dotfiles in this directory to the HOME directory. Make sure that your dotfiles are backed up somewhere safe.

Open a terminal and follow along!
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/rikkokiri/dotfiles`
2. CD into the folder: `cd dotfiles`
3. Execute the bootstrap script: `sh ./bootstrap.exclude.sh`
4. Restart your terminal or run `source .bash_profile`
